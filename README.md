The rules were as follows:
1. the code must be such that the 3pi+ should be able to complete the map from both start boxes without any changes to the code
2. the 3pi+ must cross the gap and follow the line.
3. The 3pi+ doesn't need to start from the begining of the line map however it must exit the starting box and join the line.
4. The 3pi+ must be able to identify the end of the line and return to the start box
